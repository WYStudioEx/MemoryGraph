# Deprecation Note
This tool is no longer supported starting from iOS 15. But you still can use it on lower versions for experimental purposes :)

# MemoryGraph
This application builds a memory graph of the app on which it is running on. The final graph represents relations between the various type of objects.

# Limitations
* The current version does not support macOS apps and pure swift objects
* Actual for iOS SDK 14.4 and lower and it is not guaranteed that the further  SDK releases won't affect the application's stability
* NSMallocBlocks objects are not represented in the graph
